## Introduction

Wireless power transfer is a revolutionary method to charge electric vehicles without the need for physical cables. This project focuses on designing and simulating a WPT system in MATLAB that can efficiently transfer power across a gap to the EV's battery.

## Features

- **WPT System Design:** Model the transmitter and receiver coils for efficient power transfer.
- **Simulation Environment:** MATLAB-based simulation to test various configurations and parameters.
- **Efficiency Analysis:** Evaluate the power transfer efficiency under different conditions.
- **Parameter Optimization:** Adjust parameters such as coil distance, frequency, and alignment for optimal performance.

## Technologies Used

- MATLAB
- Simulink
- Power Electronics

## Installation
